## Description

This is a OOD practice. <br/>
Implemented several classes and helper modules. <br/>
Inheritance (where human player inherits default player mode) was used. <br/>
Encapsulation (where code maker's secret key has to be private) was used. <br/>


## Executing program

* Current version runs in terminal
```
ruby game.rb
```

## Sprint History

* Sprint 1
    * Build the game assuming the computer randomly selects the secret colors and the human player must guess them. A proper feedback on how good the guess was each turn is given.
* Sprint 2
    * Refactor the code to allow the human player to choose whether they want to be the creator of the secret code or the guesser.
* Sprint 3
    * If human wants to be the code maker to choose their own secret colors, the computer will guess randomly.

Todo: implement UI, implement strategy for computer guess
